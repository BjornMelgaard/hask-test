Extensions from https://github.com/commercialhaskell/rio#language-extensions

# common

RankNTypes - allow use forall

TupleSections - allow use (,,, )

# for https://hackage.haskell.org/package/first-class-families (e.g. allows to compose functors without newtype)

- DataKinds - user defined kinds through datatype promotion

- PolyKinds - enables kind polymorphism

```
Haskell has:
- lifted types (kind *)
- unlifted type (kind * -> ...)
- unboxed types (kind #, just like * except that the types with kind # aren't behind a pointer)
```

TODO: continue

- TypeFamilies - allows use family declarations (`data family`) and associated data types in class (`class Foo where data Bar :: *`)

- TypeInType (maybe unsafe!!!) - Type becomes a synonym of `*`, so instead of rather cryptic `*->*` we can write a self explanatory `Type -> Type`. Also, the kind of `Type` is also `Type`

- TypeOperators - allows to make `type (â—‹) f g a = f (g a)`

- UndecidableInstances (maybe unsafe!!!) - by default right instance - if all of the parameters of the typeclass get smaller as you walk backwards into the instance dependencies, but with `UndecidableInstances` ........................

TODO: https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/5zjwym/when_is_undecidableinstances_okay_to_use/deynhlx/

# Other

- MultiParamTypeClasses - allows type classes which can take multiple arguments - Multi-parameter type class (MPTC)

```hs
class Monad m => VarMonad m v where
  new :: a -> m (v a)
  get :: v a -> m a
  put :: v a -> a -> m ()

instance VarMonad IO IORef where ...
instance VarMonad (ST s) (STRef s) where ...
```

- FunctionalDependencies - Naive use of MPTCs may result in ambiguity, so functional dependencies were developed as a method of resolving that ambiguity, declaring that some subset of the parameters is sufficient to determine the values of the others
